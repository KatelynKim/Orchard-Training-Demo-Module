Hello you!

@*
This is a view template written in the Razor language (although not much to see from Razor here). You could use ASPX or 
even PHP templates BTW, but let's not talk about them for now :-).
Notice how when you open this page the above string gets injected into the layout.
This file's path and name is determined by standard ASP.NET MVC naming conventions.

NEXT STATION: Controllers/DependencyInjectionController is what's next.
