/*
    The way Orchard names the classes of the menu items is that it starts with "navicon", and then comes each word in 
    the caption of the menu item separated with a dash.
    For example, a menu item named "Example" will be applied with a class named:
        navicon-example
    In our case, the caption is "Person List dashboard", so the class will be:
        navicon-person-list-dashboard
    For submenu items, the class's name will start with "subnavicon", instead of "navicon".
    NEXT STATION: Let's go back to AdminMenu.cs!
